The download_url is a link to a hosted file with your repository's
code. Github will host this for you, but only if you create a git
tag. In your repository, type: git tag 0.1 -m "Adds a tag so that we
can put this on PyPI.". Then, type git tag to show a list of tags â€”
you should see 0.1 in the list. Type git push --tags origin master to
update your code on Github with the latest tag information. Github
creates tarballs for download at
https://github.com/{username}/{module_name}/tarball/{tag}.
